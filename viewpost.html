                        <h2>Sofia - the social Robot?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>Sophia has been interviewed in the same manner as a human, striking up conversations with hosts.
                        Some replies have been nonsensical, while others have impressed interviewers such as 60 Minutes' Charlie Rose.
                        In a piece for CNBC, when the interviewer expressed concerns about robot behavior, Sophia joked that he had "been reading too much Elon Musk.
                        And watching too many Hollywood movies".Musk tweeted that Sophia could watch The Godfather and suggested "what's the worst that could happen?"
                        Business Insider's chief UK editor Jim Edwards interviewed Sophia, and while the answers were "not altogether terrible", he predicted it was a step
                        towards "conversational artificial intelligence".
                        At the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show, a BBC News reporter described talking with Sophia as "a slightly awkward experience".

                        On October 11, 2017, Sophia was introduced to the United Nations with a brief conversation with the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General, Amina J. Mohammed.
                        On October 25, at the Future Investment Summit in Riyadh, the robot was granted Saudi Arabian citizenship, becoming the first robot ever to have a nationality.
                        This attracted controversy as some commentators wondered if this implied that Sophia could vote or marry,
                        or whether a deliberate system shutdown could be considered murder.
                        Social media users used Sophia's citizenship to criticize Saudi Arabia's human rights record.
                        As explained by Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, "Women (in Saudi Arabia) have since committed suicide because they couldn’t leave
                        the house, and Sophia is running around [without a male guardian]. Saudi law doesn’t allow non-Muslims to get citizenship. Did Sophia convert to Islam?
                        What is the religion of this Sophia and why isn’t she wearing hijab? If she applied for citizenship as a human she wouldn’t get it."
                        In December 2017, Sophia's creator David Hanson said in an interview that Sophia will use her citizenship to advocate for women's rights in her now country
                        of citizenship; Newsweek criticized that "What [Hanson] means, exactly, is unclear".
